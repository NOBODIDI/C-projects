This repository contains programs created from January to May 2021. 

## Blackjack Game

This simple game of Blackjack is played alone versus the dealer, which is the computer. \
The player has to make the best decision based on the state of the game at each turn, trying to get as close to, but not above 21. \
The game was created using pseudo-random numbers, loops and relational operators. 

## Coin Change

The program prompts the user to input an amount in cents and returns the coins used to make up that amount with the minimum number of coins. 

## Triangles

The program prompts the user to input the number of rows that the triangle should have and outputs an isosceles triangle with that amount of rows using the * symbol on the command line. 

## Pascal's Triangle

The program prompts the user to input the number of rows that the triangle should have and outputs a Pascal triangle with the appropriate number of rows to the command line.

## Reversi/Othello Game

The program prompts the user to input a number n and displays an n * n board of the Reversi/Othello game. The player can then play a game against the computer, and the computer is programmed to play against the player. Both player and computer place tiles on the board until the board is filled or there are no more moves. \
The player with the largest amount of tiles at this point wins the game.
