## Blackjack Game

This simple game of Blackjack is played alone versus the dealer, which is the computer. \
The player has to make the best decision based on the state of the game at each turn, trying to get as close to, but not above 21. \
The game was created using pseudo-random numbers, loops and relational operators.
